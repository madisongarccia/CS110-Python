To use the program, input any age. The program will determine 'infant' if less than two, 'toddler' if two or less than four, 'child' from 4 to 12, 'teenager' from 13 to 17,, 'adult' from 18 to 64, and finally 'senior' from 65 and beyond. The user will see a message stating: “This person’s age category:" with the given category name attached at the end.

This program converts either Euros, Yen, Rupees, Yuan, or Bitcoin to US currency.

The user is prompted to first determine which currency they want to convert from by entering the first letter of the currency name ex. 'r','b' etc. Then the program uses conditionals to determine which currency to use, and then asks the user to enter what amount of money they would like to convert. It stores this value and matches it with the correct currency conversion and stores the new value as 'US_dollars'. It finally prints to the screen: “In U.S. dollars, that is" US_dollars.
