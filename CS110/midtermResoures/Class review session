for loops and while loops

for loops: repeats for a specified number of times 
for i in range
syntax = for <variable> in thing:
for <variable> in range(<start>,<end>,<inc>)
range(5) gives 01234
need to have a specific amount of times you want it to run

while loops: condition-controlled
repeat while a specified contion is true, ends when it is no longer true
use when you don't know how many times it will run
eventually something will happen to make it stop
while <boolean>
	<code inside must eventually make the boolean false>
use for input validation

gemstones lab

initialize variables that tell how many of each were collected
boolean called collect - means if its true, the user still wants to get more gems


#main() functions
should be the last function defined
don't compute anything


turtles
test question will be very similar to practice problem
first must import turtle        import turtle
create turtle graphics screen   screen = turtle.Screen()
make one or more turtles        
color, pen, movement
start at (0,0)
always start facing east (to the right)
ted.forward()
ted.left()
ted.right()

going over practice problem for turtles

pentagon spiral
initialize sideLength to 2
and we know we want 100 sides so numSides=100
use for loop because we want it to loop exactly 100 times
go forward 2, turn right 72 degrees (360/5), then increase sidelength by 2 to increase the next side so it makes a spiral

Hard problem
