The purpose of this program is to create my own version of string functions to use in place of the pre-defined Python ones.

The first function will take a string input and capitalize each letter by increasing the ASCII value by 32 to reach the capitalized version of the letter.
The next function takes away all the spaces in a given string by identifying a space by its ASCII value and adding an empty string in its place.
The replace function I created has a conditional statement that first checks if the character in the string matches the first character provided as the second parameter, if it does then that gets switched to char2's value and is reprinted with char2 in place of the original character.
