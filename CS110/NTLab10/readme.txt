The purpose of this program is to refer to a text file that contains data on the amount of bikes per family in our class, and perform math calculations on that data. 

The program uses a main function that first opens and reads a text file containing the amount of bikes each person in the class said their family owns. Next it defines many variables that are used to compute the toal amount of families, which is how many lines in the text file there were since each value was representative of a family. Next it converted each string to an integer and calculated the sum of those integer values. Finally, since they were added to a list I was able to use functions to find the max and min values.
