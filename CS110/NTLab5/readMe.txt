This program is supposed to display a menu of gems a user can choose from to collect. When they are done collecting the gems, their total points will be added up and shown at the end of the game.

HOW IT WORKS
It opens with a welomr message and asks the user which gems out of a list they would like to collect. There are four gem options and a fifth option that would exit the shop. For whichever gem assigned to the number chosen, they will then be asked how many of that gem they would like to collect. When the player is finished, they are returned to the menu with the option to choose more gems or exit the game. When exited, the final screen will show a menu of all the gems and the total amount collected of each.
